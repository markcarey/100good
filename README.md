# Stream2Own NFTs

Stream2Own (S2O) NFTs are owned by higher streamer. Instead of buying and selling the NFTs, you send a real-time stream. As long as your stream continues, you are the owner of the NFT. But if someone sends a higher stream, they take ownership of the NFT. If you want it back, you have to start an even higher stream. Stream2Own NFTs are thus "always on sale" and always have a (per-second) price.

## Not to be confiused with "NFT Rentals"

While the owner is continually paying to own the NFT, _the object here is NOT to provide a rental system for conventional NFTs_. Becausr these NFTs cannot be "locked", they can always be immediately taken by anyone willing to start a higher stream. This is definitely not what you want if you own a valuable NFT that you wnat to monetize without giving up ownership. _Stream2Own NFTs are an entirely different animal, with various use cases that may not work with legacy NFTs_. Potential use cases include web3 game items and exclusive token-gated memberships. The game theory incentives may provide interesting opportunities for stream-traders and unique monetization approaches for NFT game, membership, and other projects.
